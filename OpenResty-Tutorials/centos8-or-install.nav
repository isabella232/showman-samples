    Hi, I'm Matthew from OpenResty Inc. Today I'd demonstrate how to install OpenResty on CentOS 8 via `dnf`.

        ssh centos8-min
        [NEWSH][NOP]
        $ cat /etc/os-release

    [S] We'll use this fresh install of CentOS 8 in this video.

desc:
    We can always goto the [openresty.org](https://openresty.org/) web site to find the instructions.

goto "https://openresty.org"

    Then click on the Installation menu.

desc(sync):
    We can find all the commands for enabling the yum repository and installing the OpenResty rpm packages.

term:
    Back to our CentOS 8 system, first install the standard `wget` package if you don't have it already.

        $ sudo dnf -y install wget

    Use `wget` to download the openresty.repo file from our site.

        $ wget 'https://openresty.org/package/centos/openresty.repo'

    We move this file into the yum repositories' configuration directory.

        $ sudo mv openresty.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/

    [S] Note that we need `sudo` here.

    We update the yum index database.

        [FAIL] $ sudo dnf check-update > /dev/null 2>&1

    Now it's time to install our main RPM package, `openresty`.

        $ sudo dnf -y install openresty

    Check if the `openresty` executable is available.

        $ which openresty

    This `openresty` executable is just a symbolic link.

        $ file `which openresty`

    And check its version.

        $ openresty -V

    We can start the default openresty server like this.

        $ sudo systemctl start openresty

    Check if the nginx processes are up and running.

        $ ps aux|grep nginx

    [S] Perfect.

    Test the default home page with the `curl` command.

        $ curl 127.0.0.1/

    [S] Yay, it's working.

    Note, however, that the `resty` command-line utility is not installed yet.

        $ which resty

    If you want it, then you can install the `openresty-resty` RPM package from the same repository.

        $ sudo dnf -y install openresty-resty

    Now it should be ready.

        $ which resty
        $ resty -e 'print("Hello Resty")'

    Similarly, if you want to use the `restydoc` command-line utility, you should install the `openresty-doc` package.

        $ sudo dnf -y install openresty-doc

    Now it's available too.

        restydoc -s content_by_lua_file
        [SLEEP=1] [SP] [NOP]
        [SLEEP=1] q [NONL]
        $

    We can also install OPM for installing more Lua modules contributed by the OpenResty community.

        $ sudo dnf -y install openresty-opm

    We can try installing the `lua-resty-http` library authored by James Hurst.

        $ sudo opm get pintsized/lua-resty-http

    Try loading it with the `resty` utility.

        $ resty -e 'require "resty.http"'

    [S] Success!

    There is also a debug build of OpenResty which includes debugging logs and all the internal assertions enabled.

        $ sudo dnf -y install openresty-debug

    We can invoke this debug version of openresty like this.

        $ which openresty-debug

    This `openresty-debug` executable is also a symbolic link.

        $ file `which openresty-debug`

    [S] We should never use it in production since it is much slower than the release build.

    Furthermore, there are also special builds for checking memory issues via Valgrind and Address Sanitizer.

        $ sudo dnf list openresty-valgrind openresty-asan

    [S] Try these when you have memory issues to debug. We may cover these in future tutorials.

    To upgrade OpenResty packages to their latest versions, just run these commands.

        [FAIL] $ sudo dnf check-update > /dev/null 2>&1
        $ sudo dnf upgrade 'openresty*'

    To check all the available packages in our openresty repository.

        dnf --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo="openresty" list available | less
        [SLEEP=1] [SP] [NOP]
        [SLEEP=1] [SP] [NOP]

    [S] We've got a lot of binary packages here.

        [SLEEP=1] q [NONL]
        $

desc:
    We can find detailed documentation for all these RPM packages on this web page.

goto "https://openresty.org/en/rpm-packages.html"

desc:
    We have indeed got a lot of packages for the user to choose from.
